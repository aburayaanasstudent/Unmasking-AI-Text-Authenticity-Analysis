## Key Features
- **Extensive Data Collection**  
  Utilizes three comprehensive text-only datasets comprising human-written and AI-generated samples.

- **Rich Feature Extraction**  
  - **BERT Embeddings** for contextual insights.  
  - **Sentiment Scores** to capture emotional tone.  
  - **Text Readability** measurements to gauge complexity.  
  - **POS Tagging** for structural and grammatical insights.  
  - **Repetitiveness** measures identifying repetitive patterns.

- **Statistical Validation**  
  Each feature is selected based on hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis, ensuring it significantly contributes to classification performance.

- **High Accuracy**  
  The final model demonstrates outstanding precision and recall when distinguishing AI-generated text from human-written text across diverse domains.
